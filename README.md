** A stage designed for the elderly easily find someone to chat, share and have fun. **

LIHAO app is incredibly simple, and easy to use. From the beginning to the end, there are several local audio tours helping elderly register, set chatting preference and make saving list. Interesting voice-chat app lets elderly no matter sharing their life experiences or finding someone to chat easily.
